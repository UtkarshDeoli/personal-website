# Who am I ?

Hello, I am Utkarsh from India. Currently, I am enrolled in an undergraduate program. I have extensive experience in Embedded Engineering, which I have pursued as a hobby for the past 5-6 years. With this expertise, I have freelanced as an Arduino developer. Additionally, I am proficient in Flutter and have completed several projects. Presently, I am learning web development and am interested in exploring machine learning and its applications.

<p>
During the summer vacation of 2014, I received an electronics starter kit, sparking a deep interest in tinkering. Completely new to the field at the time, I eagerly dived into experimentation. Despite my initial lack of knowledge, I eagerly explored Google for circuit designs. Using only a timer 555, I embarked on a self-guided journey of learning through YouTube tutorials, gradually honing my skills and expanding my understanding of electronics.
