Download the latest Arch Linux ISO image. Step 2: Create Bootable Media # Use a USB drive or a CD/DVD to create a bootable installation media. You can use tools like Rufus, Etcher, or dd command on Linux to write the ISO image to the media. Step 3: Boot into Arch Linux Live Environment # Insert the bootable media into your computer and boot from it. You will be greeted with the Arch Linux boot menu. Step 4: Set the Keyboard Layout # Use the loadkeys command to set your keyboard layout if necessary. For example, for a US keyboard layout, you would use loadkeys us. Step 5: Connect to the Internet # Use the ip link command to identify your network interface. Use ip link set \u0026lt;interface\u0026gt; up to bring up the interface. Use wifi-menu to connect to a Wi-Fi network, or dhcpcd to obtain an IP address via DHCP for a wired connection. Step 6: Partition the Disk # Use tools like fdisk, parted, or cfdisk to partition your disk. Create at least one partition for the root filesystem (e.g., /dev/sda1). Step 7: Format the Partitions # Format the partitions using appropriate filesystems. For example, use mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 to format a partition with the ext4 filesystem. Step 8: Mount the Partitions # Mount the root partition to /mnt. For example, mount /dev/sda1 /mnt. Step 9: Install the Base System # Use the pacstrap command to install the base system packages. For example, pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware. Step 10: Generate an fstab File # Generate an fstab file to define how disk partitions should be mounted. Use genfstab -U /mnt \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /mnt/etc/fstab. Step 11: Chroot into the Installed System # Use arch-chroot to change the root into the installed system. For example, arch-chroot /mnt. Step 12: Set the Time Zone # Set the correct time zone using the ln command. For example, ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime. Step 13: Generate Localization Settings # Uncomment desired locales in /etc/locale.gen. Generate the locales with locale-gen. Set the system language with echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 \u0026gt; /etc/locale.conf. Step 14: Set Hostname # Set the hostname of your system with echo myhostname \u0026gt; /etc/hostname. Step 15: Set Root Password # Set the root password with the passwd command. Step 16: Install a Boot Loader # Install a boot loader like GRUB or systemd-boot. For GRUB, install it with pacman -S grub and then run grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdX (replace /dev/sdX with your disk). Generate the GRUB configuration file with grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg. Step 17: Reboot # Exit the chroot environment by typing exit. Unmount all mounted partitions with umount -R /mnt. Reboot your system with reboot.

Currently, I am enrolled in an undergraduate program. I have extensive experience in Embedded Engineering, which I have pursued as a hobby for the past 5-6 years. With this expertise, I have freelanced as an Arduino developer. Additionally, I am proficient in Flutter and have completed several projects. Presently, I am learning web development and am interested in exploring machine learning and its applications.\nTimeline # Present 2022-present Joined University\nFreelancing 2020-2021 Freelanced on fiverr as an Arduino Developer\nCompleted School 2018-2020 Science Exhibitions Loved to participare!

Completely new to the field at the time, I eagerly dived into experimentation. Despite my initial lack of knowledge, I eagerly explored Google for circuit designs. Using only a timer 555, I embarked on a self-guided journey of learning through YouTube tutorials, gradually honing my skills and expanding my understanding of electronics.

DSA is one of the most important skills that every computer science student must have. It is often seen that people with good knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others and thus, crack the interviews of almost every tech giant.\n![[DSAIMG.png]]\nWhat is Data Structure? # A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.\nWhat is Algorithm? # Algorithm is defined as a process or set of well-defined instructions that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or perform a specific type of calculation. To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.\nHow to start learning DSA? # The first and foremost thing is dividing the total procedure into little pieces which need to be done sequentially. The complete process to learn DSA from scratch can be broken into 4 parts:\n1. [[02 Time and Space complexities]] # Data Structures\nStacks Queue Linked List Tree Graph 3.
