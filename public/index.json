Some of my favorite self-hosted applications include:\nNextcloud – A powerful alternative to cloud storage services. Jellyfin – A feature-rich home media server. VS Code Server – A remote-accessible coding environment. However, accessing these applications remotely presents a few challenges. Traditionally, you would need:\nA public IP address A cloud or home server Using a public IP can be risky, as it exposes your home network to potential security threats. While renting a VPS from a cloud provider is an option, hosting high-storage and high-RAM applications like Nextcloud and Jellyfin can quickly become expensive. So, what’s the alternative?\nEnter Cloudflare Tunnels – a secure way to expose local applications to the internet without needing a public IP.\nHow Cloudflare Tunnels Work # Cloudflare Tunnels use a lightweight service called Cloudflared to create a secure, reverse tunnel between your local machine and Cloudflare’s global network. This allows you to expose applications on your local network to the public internet via a Cloudflare-managed domain, eliminating the need for port forwarding or a static IP.\nKey Benefits: # No need for a public IP. Secure, encrypted connections. Easy configuration and management. Works with HTTP, SSH, RDP, and SMB traffic. Here’s a simplified illustration of how Cloudflare Tunnels function:\n[Local Application] → [Cloudflared] → [Cloudflare Edge] → [Public Internet] Now, let’s set up our first tunnel!\nPrerequisites # To follow along, you’ll need:\nA domain registered with Cloudflare. Cloudflare nameservers configured for your domain. A Cloudflare Zero Trust account (requires credit card verification). Installing Cloudflared # Cloudflared is available on multiple platforms, including:\nLinux (AMD64, ARM, ARM64, x86) Docker Windows macOS Installing on Linux # Run the following command (replace $ARCH with your system’s architecture):\nwget -q https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-{$ARCH}.deb \\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-{$ARCH}.deb Authenticating Cloudflared # Once installed, authenticate your Cloudflare account:\ncloudflared tunnel login This will open a browser window for you to authorize the domain you want to use for tunnels. After logging in, Cloudflare saves your credentials at:\n/home/$USER/.cloudflared/cert.pem Creating a Test Application (NGINX) # To test our tunnel, let’s set up a simple NGINX server inside a Docker container.\nInstall Docker (if not already installed): # sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install docker.io Run NGINX inside a Docker container: # docker run --name tunnel-nginx -p 5000:80 --detach nginx:latest This command will:\nPull the latest NGINX image (if not available locally). Name the container tunnel-nginx. Map port 5000 on the host to port 80 inside the container. Run the container in detached mode. Verify the running container:\ndocker ps Access NGINX at:\nhttp://localhost:5000 Creating and Configuring the Cloudflare Tunnel # Step 1: Create the Tunnel # cloudflared tunnel create nginx-tunnel This generates a credentials file and provides a Tunnel ID. Keep this file secure.\nStep 2: Configure the Tunnel # Create a config file at /home/$USER/.cloudflared/nginx-tunnel.yml with the following content:\n--- tunnel: \u0026lt;UUID\u0026gt; credentials-file: /home/$USER/.cloudflared/\u0026lt;UUID\u0026gt;.json ingress: - hostname: tunnel.\u0026lt;your-domain\u0026gt; service: http://localhost:5000 - service: http_status:404 Replace \u0026lt;UUID\u0026gt; with your Tunnel ID and \u0026lt;your-domain\u0026gt; with your actual domain.\nStep 3: Create a Public DNS Record # cloudflared tunnel route dns nginx-tunnel tunnel.\u0026lt;your-domain\u0026gt; This will create a DNS record in Cloudflare that routes traffic through the tunnel.\nRunning the Tunnel # To start the tunnel, run:\ncloudflared tunnel --config /home/$USER/.cloudflared/nginx-tunnel.yml run Your NGINX server should now be accessible via https://tunnel**.** from the public internet!\nConclusion # With Cloudflare Tunnels, we securely exposed our local NGINX server to the internet without opening ports or requiring a public IP. This method ensures better security and flexibility, allowing us to host applications remotely with ease.\nBeyond basic use cases, Cloudflare Tunnels can also:\nSecurely expose SSH, RDP, or SMB traffic. Protect entire private networks with Cloudflare WARP. Implement Cloudflare Access for granular security controls.
